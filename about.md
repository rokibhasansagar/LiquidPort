# Where am I?
An official website of Liquid Porting & Development team, which is aimed to bring the latest software to legacy devices using Qualcomm Snapdragon or MediaTek CPU.
We are usually working on cheap mid-range devices with lack of support from their OEM or the community.
Our goal is to provide stable, reliable and fresh software built directly from the source with **NO EXTERNAL MODIFICATIONS** such as additional apps, tweaks and other
useless stuff.

We currently support over 30 devices which are getting the latest builds of TeamWin Recovery and custom ROMs built from the latest sources.
We are still adding new devices to our build roster, so if you are interested in maintaining a new device, contact us and we'll add it to our build roster to be
able to provide new builds from us.

That's pretty much all from me, I hope you'll enjoy our work.

### FAQ

**Q: What does it cost?**

_A: Nothing, you are free to use anything that you'll find there._

**Q: Can I share a ROM or Recovery from this webpage on my blog, XDA forum or somewhere else?**

_A: Sure, but don't forget to mention us in **Credits** section._

**Q: I found a bug in your ROM, what next? How to fix it?**

_A: Start recording a logcat, try to reproduce the issue and send us your logcat, we'll take a look at it and try to fix it in a next build._

**Q: I want my device to be supported by Liquid Porting & Development, will you build a ROM for my device?**

_A: If your device isn't supported at the moment, we can't do anything with it. We don't support the device, and don't even have access to one to test it on.
   If you're willing to buy one for us, maybe you could get some assistance, but we are not being paid for it, and owe you nothing. TWRP and LineageOS are not commercial products and
   users are not customers. It's simply impossible for us to do builds for every device._
