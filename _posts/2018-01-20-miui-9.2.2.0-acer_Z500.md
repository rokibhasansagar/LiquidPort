## What is MIUI 9?
**With MIUI 9, Xiaomi's main goal was to improve stability and speed, and to that effect the company optimized over 20 areas of the interface for better performance.
The result is that MIUI 9 feels much more responsive when compared to older versions of the ROM.
MIUI 9 comes with dynamic resource allocation which prioritizes the resources required by the app you’re using over background processes. Xiaomi is also touting faster app load times with accelerated startup.
The smoother UI with reduced latency has been the company’s big pitch for MIUI 9 to ward off the perception of it being a performance degrading overlay.**
